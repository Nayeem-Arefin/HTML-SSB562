<h1> Heading for the paragraph test document </h1> 
<h3>  The paragraph test </h1> 
<body> H1 refers to the largest size.  H6 refers to the smallest size and the least important headings.  The first paragraph should have 3 sentences without a new paragraph.  If we do not use the close paragraph tag, the sentences should go on. This is the third sentence without a break.

</p> This is the second paragraph.  <p> After adding the open paragraph tag after the end of the second paragraph, I'm starting a third paragraph</p>
