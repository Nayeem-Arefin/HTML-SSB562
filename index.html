<h1> <mark> Knowledge Database - Cooking is for everyone </mark> </h1> 
 
Cooking is a way to nurture home and family. We need to cook to eat food. However, that doesn't mean that we live to cook and to eat. In this way, cooking is an art.     <img src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/11521733/pexels-photo-11521733.jpeg" alt="city" width = "360" height ="200">

	If we search the internet we can find hundreds, if not thousands pictures of delicious dishes made by chefs and cooking enthusiasts world-wide. It could be a great activity for family bonding.  Even if you are a solo chef, you could solve many of your life's problems in this way.  If you've heard of the legendary Arnold Schwarznegger, he would solve many of the problems he was facing in the gymnasium - in his mind - while working out! It could very well be that, you could solve many of your problems - in your mind - with cooking!
